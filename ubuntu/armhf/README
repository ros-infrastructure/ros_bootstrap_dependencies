For importing armhf there are two parts. One is in the config repo for upstream packages. 

to update the upstream configs: 

`python /home/rosbuild/reprepro_updater/scripts/prepare_sync.py /var/www/repos/ros-shadow-fixed/ubuntu -y /home/rosbuild/reprepro_updater/config/namniart_armhf.yaml`


In this directory is a second config for importing the ROS indigo ROS packages. 

`python /home/rosbuild/reprepro_updater/scripts/prepare_sync.py /var/www/repos/ros-shadow-fixed/ubuntu -y /home/rosbuild/reprepro_updater/armhf/namniart_indigo.yaml`

To execute these commands add an option -c. 

Also do it for ros in addition to ros-shadow-fixed. 


There also are a few architecture any packages which need to be flooded from x86 ( libpcl-1.7-all* and libpcl-1.7-doc See #15 )

`reprepro -v -b /var/www/repos/ros-shadow-fixed/ubuntu/ flood trusty armhf`
`reprepro -v -b /var/www/repos/ros/ubuntu/ flood trusty armhf`
